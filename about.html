            <div class="om-symbol">ॐ</div>

            <p>
                Welcome to Veda Mantras, a personal project dedicated to preserving and sharing
                the timeless wisdom of the Vedas. This website presents translations and analysis
                of select Vedic mantras, making these ancient teachings accessible to modern seekers.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Vedas represent humanity's oldest continuous spiritual tradition, containing
                profound insights into the nature of reality, consciousness, and the human condition.
                Yet these treasures often remain inaccessible due to language barriers and the
                complexity of Vedic Sanskrit. This project aims to bridge that gap.
            </p>

        <!-- Mission Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>

            <p>
                The mission of Veda Mantras is threefold:
            </p>

            <div style="margin-left: 1.5rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <p>
                    <strong>1. Preserve</strong> — To maintain the authentic Sanskrit texts in their
                    original Devanagari script, ensuring the sacred sounds are preserved for future
                    generations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>2. Translate</strong> — To provide clear, accessible English translations
                    that capture both the literal meaning and the spiritual essence of the mantras.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Illuminate</strong> — To offer thoughtful commentary that places each
                    mantra in its historical, philosophical, and practical context, revealing its
                    relevance to contemporary life.
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Methodology Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Translation Methodology</h2>

            <p>
                Each mantra on this site is presented with careful attention to accuracy and clarity:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 2rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
                <li><strong>Sanskrit Text</strong> — The original mantra in Devanagari script</li>
                <li><strong>Transliteration</strong> — Roman script version using IAST (International
                    Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration) for precise pronunciation guidance</li>
                <li><strong>Translation</strong> — English rendering that balances literal accuracy
                    with readability and spiritual depth</li>
                <li><strong>Commentary</strong> — Analysis drawing from traditional interpretations,
                    classical commentaries, and personal insights</li>
            </ul>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                The translations presented here are study aids, not replacements for learning from
                qualified teachers. The Vedic tradition emphasizes the guru-shishya (teacher-student)
                relationship as essential for true understanding of these sacred texts.

            <h2>Understanding the Four Vedas</h2>

            <p>
                The Vedic literature is organized into four primary collections, each serving a
                unique purpose:
            </p>

            <div style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
                <p>
                    <strong>Rig Veda (ऋग्वेद)</strong> — The "Veda of Praise," containing 1,028 hymns
                    to various deities. It is the oldest and most foundational of the Vedas, exploring
                    themes of cosmic order, divine worship, and philosophical inquiry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Yajur Veda (यजुर्वेद)</strong> — The "Veda of Ritual," providing prose
                    formulas and instructions for performing sacred ceremonies. It exists in two
                    versions: Krishna (Black) and Shukla (White) Yajur Veda.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sama Veda (सामवेद)</strong> — The "Veda of Melodies," setting Rig Vedic
                    verses to musical notation. It is considered the origin of Indian classical music
                    and demonstrates the power of sacred sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Atharva Veda (अथर्ववेद)</strong> — The "Veda of Daily Life," containing
                    hymns for healing, protection, and practical concerns. It also includes profound
                    philosophical speculations and is the foundation of Ayurvedic medicine.
