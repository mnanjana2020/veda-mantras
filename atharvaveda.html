            <p>
                The Atharva Veda is the fourth Veda, named after the sage Atharvan who is credited
                with discovering fire and establishing its sacred rituals. Unlike the other three
                Vedas which focus primarily on ritual worship, the Atharva Veda addresses the
                practical concerns of daily life — healing, protection, prosperity, and longevity.
            </p>

            <p>
                Often called the "Veda of the People," it contains 730 hymns with approximately
                6,000 verses covering medicine (the foundation of Ayurveda), philosophy, cosmology,
                and prayers for various life situations. The Atharva Veda also includes some of the
                most profound philosophical hymns, including early explorations of Brahman and the
                nature of reality.

                <h3>Commentary</h3>
                <p>
                    The Prithvi Sukta (Bhumi Sukta) is a remarkable hymn of 63 verses dedicated to
                    Mother Earth. Composed over 3,000 years ago, it expresses profound ecological
                    awareness and reverence for the natural world that resonates powerfully today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Satyam (Truth)</strong> — The foundation that upholds all existence<br>
                    <strong>Ritam (Cosmic Order)</strong> — The natural law that governs the universe<br>
                    <strong>Tapas (Austerity)</strong> — Spiritual discipline and self-restraint<br>
                    <strong>Brahma & Yajna</strong> — Sacred knowledge and sacrificial offerings
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hymn teaches that the Earth is sustained not merely by physical forces but
                    by moral and spiritual principles. Human righteousness directly affects the
                    well-being of the planet — a teaching that anticipates modern environmental ethics.

                <h3>Commentary</h3>
                <p>
                    This powerful healing mantra reflects the Atharva Veda's role as the foundation
                    of Ayurveda (the science of life). Ancient Vedic healers combined herbal medicine
                    with mantras, understanding that healing occurs on physical, mental, and spiritual
                    levels simultaneously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Nirrti</strong> — The goddess of decay and destruction, representing the
                    forces that lead to death and dissolution<br>
                    <strong>Shata-sharada</strong> — "Hundred autumns," the Vedic ideal of a full
                    lifespan of 100 years
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Atharva Veda contains numerous such healing prayers, establishing the
                    principle that spiritual intervention can restore health even in dire circumstances.
                    This holistic approach continues in Ayurvedic medicine today.

                <h3>Commentary</h3>
                <p>
                    This magnificent Shanti Sukta envisions peace radiating through every level of
                    existence — from the celestial realms to the earth, from the waters to the plants,
                    from all beings to the ultimate reality (Brahman).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The prayer recognizes that true peace cannot exist in isolation. Peace must
                    pervade:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cosmic level</strong> — Dyaus (sky/heaven) and Antariksha (atmosphere)<br>
                    <strong>Natural level</strong> — Earth, waters, plants, and trees<br>
                    <strong>Divine level</strong> — All the gods and Brahman itself<br>
                    <strong>Personal level</strong> — "May that peace come to me"
                </p>
                <p>
                    This holistic vision of peace — extending from the cosmic to the personal —
                    represents one of humanity's earliest and most beautiful prayers for universal
                    harmony.
